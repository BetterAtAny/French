    Important Tip: {Subject/Who} <- Sentence Starter 

Singular Person 
    Je - I 
    Tu - You 
    Il - He 
    Elle - She 
    On - We (General) 

Plural / Multiple People 
    Nous - We [Plural] 
    Vous - You 
    Ils - They [Masculine] 
    Elles - They [Femineme] 

    Quick Tip: Elles is only girls if 1 boy enters then its becomes Ils not the same for Masculine 
               in Masculine if a girl enters its still Ils 

Important: You need to have a subject and a verb for a Sentence 
           e.g. I like French/J'aime francais 
                    I/J' = Subject 
                    Like/aime = Verb
           
           If you don't want to be specific about gender use "On" or a group of many people 
           e.g "Class, Family, etc..."
